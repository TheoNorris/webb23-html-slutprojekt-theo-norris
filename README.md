I am creating this project to showcase some of the projects I have created so far as a web developer for potential employees and anybody else that is interested in the work I have created.

## Wireframes

My wireframes were made using Justinminds. You can view them [here](assets/wireframes).

 ## UX
 
 This website has been created for anyone that is interested in viewing the work that I have created so far as a web developer. The website will be an artistic, easy to use website for anyone that is interested in learning more about the projects I have created and contacting me in regards to this.

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website is.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the creator has.
 * As a user I can view the different projects the creator had and navigate myself to them to find out more.
 * As a user I can navigate myself through to the about, projects and contact page through links provided.
 * As a user I can view various projects on their individual htmls and find links to the existing web pages.
 * As a user I can view information on the creator on their own about me page
 * As a user I can complete a contact form and send it, if I would like to find out more about the creator.
 
## Existing Features

 * A navigation bar allowing users to scroll through the various pages.
 * Social links opening the associated web pages in a new window.
 * A portfolio of projects that are easy to select to find out more on the individual project chosen.
 * Links to the existing websites of the projects.

 ### Features left to implement

 Possibly a google maps API and a gallery of selectable projects when my portfolio has several more projects.

## Testing

Having written my code for each .html page I have validated them on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The same applies to my css which I have validated on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

1. Navbar
* Going through each of the pages, I clicked on each navigation bar link to ensure all pages worked individually.

2. Social Media links
- I went to the social media links on each of the pages and clicked on them to ensure they opened up in new tabs using 'target="_blank"'.

3. Portfolio thumbnails
- Went to each thumbnail and checked that they linked to the correct project.

4. Portfolio images
- I checked whether the porfolio images enlarged correctly without overflowing over the page on a range of different device sizes

5. Contact form
- I checked the contact form was responsive and that the contact email was sent if used.

6. Website links
- I checked if all of the links to the projects external websites were correct and they opened in a new window using 'target="_blank"'.

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, having
tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphones, a macbook
and desktop.
